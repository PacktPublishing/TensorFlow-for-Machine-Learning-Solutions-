## About the Video Course
TensorFlow is an open source software library for Machine Intelligence. The independent solutions in this video course will teach you how to use TensorFlow for complex data computations and will let you dig deeper and gain more insights into your data than ever before. You’ll work through solutions on training models, model evaluation and sentiment analysis – each using Google’s machine learning library TensorFlow.This guide starts with the fundamentals of the TensorFlow library which includes variables, matrices, and various data sources. Moving ahead, you will get hands-on experience with Linear Regression techniques with TensorFlow
